# About This Project
For my Capstone Project, I was tasked with improving a program I created in a previous course. The revisions had to include improvements to the software engineering, the database, and the algorithms. I chose to upgrade a rudimentary cellphone app I created in my Mobile Architechure course. The first step in this process was to critique the original program and outline a plan of improvement.
